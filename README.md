## Reflection

This was a 2 days project built as an assignment. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

I started this process by using the `npx create-next-app` boilerplate.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Server Side Rendering and url change without refresh. This lead me to spend a some time on a research spike into Next.js, next/router.
